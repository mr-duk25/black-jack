# Black-jack

**Black-Jack:** AKA 21 is a  card game whose object is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. Two through ten count at face value.
Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10 and Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.
